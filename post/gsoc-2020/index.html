                <p>The <a
                        href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_noqqI6e2nhQ3FFz-290K0OgzB7soN7u/view?usp=sharing">project
                        proposal</a> I had submitted aimed to take <a href="https://github.com/tikv/tikv">TiKV</a>
                    closer to full cloud native support. A vague understanding of the project allowed me to put forward
                    the idea of supporting cloud based data stores such as AWS S3 to the TiKV storage engine, i.e.
                    rocksdb, by making use of the <a href="https://github.com/rockset/rocksdb-cloud">rocksdb-cloud</a>
                    library. The ideas put forward by the team at TiKV also helped to better formulate a plan that has
                    been worked on through various PRs to the sister projects that associate with the storage component
                    of the Database. The main issue being worked on was initiated well before the GSoC project started
                    and can be found at <a href="https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/6506">tikv/tikv#6506</a>.</p>
                <p>during the community boding period, <a href="https://github.com/yiwu-arbug">Yi Wu(@yiwu-arbug)</a>
                    ideated further on the project with <a href="https://github.com/little-wallace">Liu
                        Wei(@little-wallace)</a>, who compiled a <a
                        href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rEmexICjwWe02XHWOGqNBs6zA6QpFh11d-XBt5Pvp8M/edit?usp=sharing">document
                        with details about the desired results from the project</a>, while I was making use of the time
                    to go through the <a href="https://tikv.org/docs">documentation</a> and do compilations, tests,
                    etc, getting familiarized with the code as well as resulting in a few PRs to fix write-ups at <a
                        href="https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/6740">tikv#6740</a> and <a
                        href="https://github.com/tikv/website/pull/161">tikv/website#161</a>.</p><p>I also started
                    to maintain a <a href="https://github.com/users/de-sh/projects/1">GitHub project</a> to organise
                    the work plans and provide direction to my GSoC work, you can find a <a
                        href="https://github.com/users/de-sh/projects/1#card-40733594">list of memos(weekly
                        reports)</a> that have been written by me to help document work done on a weekly basis as well
                    as the sub-tasks and other achievements made over the stretch of the project timeline. In the
                    meantime I had also updated details relating to the TiKV project on the <a
                        href="http://l.cncf.io">CNCF landscape</a> by making a PR, <a
                        href="https://github.com/cncf/landscape/pull/1677">cncf/landscape#1677</a></p><img

                    align="left" height="600" width="550" alt="Diagram describing my understanding of the overall
                    task without details prior to phase 1">
                <p><em>This is a diagram that concisely depicts my understanding of how the task was to achieve cloud
                        nativity, how different it really was from the task can be depicted in another diagram</em></p>
                <h3>Phase 1</h3><p>While working on the refined proposal mentioned earlier I ended up contributing
                    <a href="https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/8066">tikv#8066</a>, which updated the rusoto crate and
                    utilised a single interface for identity management, leading to clearing up a few lines of code. The
                    merger of this PR provided me a boost, but an update from Liu alerted me to how off track I had been
                    with respect to the proposal document. Considering Liu was busy and unable to provide the necessary
                    guidance for me to get started in contributing to the project, it was decided that a better plan had
                    to be put in place and thus Yi took back full charge of the project and drafted the issue <a
                        href="https://github.com/tikv/rust-rocksdb/issues/514">tikv/rust-rocksdb#514</a> which we
                    utilised most of June-July to work on.</p><p>There were a lot of firsts for me in this, including
                    my first try at writing a <a
                        href="https://github.com/tikv/rust-rocksdb/blob/master/librocksdb_sys/librocksdb_cloud_sys/CMakeLists.txt"><code>CMakeLists.txt</code></a>
                    and creating a CPP-rust FFI interface, which essentially contributed to <a
                        href="https://github.com/tikv/rust-rocksdb/pull/517">tikv/rust-rocksdb#517</a>. Through July
                    the project started to catch pace as Yi helped me in figuring out how to solve issues and experiment
                    with various methods of achieving the allotted tasks, there were a lot of new learnings from the
                    project. The editions made to sister projects also include <a
                        href="https://github.com/tikv/rocksdb/pull/181">tikv/rocksdb#181</a> which provides a solution
                    to the problems in compiling changes added by rust-rocksdb#517. The changes related to the #517 also
                    includes the creation of the <a
                        href="https://github.com/tikv/rocksdb/pull/181"><code>6.4.cloud</code> branch in
                        tikv/rocksdb</a>. Most of these PRs were merged at the end of July, closing phase 1 of the
                    project.</p><h3>Phase 2</h3><p>The second stage started with Yi Wu opening <a
                        href="https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issue/8367">tikv#8367</a> to provide checkpoints for adding
                    the newly availed rust-rocksdb <code>cloud</code> feature to tikv. I have opened a PR <a
                        href="https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/8383">tikv#8383</a> to solve the same and have
                    achieved the task to a respectable point. This is where we found out that the code doesn't really
                    build as we intended it to, issues largely with linking the cloud code with the AWS-CPP-SDK and to
                    some extent the compilation of cloud features that merged with #517, solving which I have opened <a
                        href="https://github.com/tikv/rust-rocksdb/pull/529">rust-rocksdb#529</a> and a <a
                        href="https://github.com/tikv/rocksdb/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ade-sh+fix">few associated PRs
                        in tikv/rocksdb</a>, but this will take a lot more work.</p><h3>Phase 3</h3><p>The final
                    stage of the project had been initiated on the back of building in S3 as a storage engine for TiKV.
                    The test phase as I'd like to refer to it is focused on providing documentation of the observable
                    performance benchmarks for S3, achieved using the <a href="https://github.com/axboe/fio">fio
                        tool</a>, one can find the related findings as follows:</p><ol><li><a

                    </li></ol><h3>Plans from here on</h3><p>I plan to take the project to compilation as the
                    hurdles we are currently facing don't seem to be insurmountable. But I also intend to get back to
                    academics for now, I am currently a senior at college and as part of my final year project, I intend
                    to work on the learning I have attained from this project and apply it in the multimedia field, hope
                    to keep everyone updated on it in the coming days!</p><p>If you are interested in helping out with
                    the project and taking it forward, please consider giving the <a
                        href="https://github.com/users/de-sh/projects/1">GitHub Project</a> a look.</p>
